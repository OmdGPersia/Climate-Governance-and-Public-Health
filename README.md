# The Intersection of Climate Governance and Public Health: A Data-Driven Investigation
Climate policies prioritize environmental sustainability but may also be influenced by health concerns from environmental degradation. Air pollution represents a critical public health issue, causing millions of premature deaths annually (WHO, 2023). Climate change worsens air pollution through multiple pathways: increased desert dust, more frequent wildfires, accelerated ozone formation, and altered atmospheric patterns trapping pollutants. These changes create a feedback loop where climate policy becomes increasingly relevant to public health. However, how health data shapes and affects climate governance remains underexplored.
Despite growing recognition of health co-benefits from climate change mitigation, a significant research gap exists in understanding how these benefits influence policy development. Studies in Australia and the EU reveal very limited integration of health considerations into climate policies, while comprehensive research on how air pollution health data shapes climate governance remains notably scarce.
This short data-driven study examines how public health burdens influence climate policymaking at regional and global scales, investigating whether worsening health crises catalyse stronger environmental regulations or if political and economic constraints hinder policy adjustments. Rather than evaluating policy effectiveness in reducing emissions, we analyse whether variations in health data—particularly air pollution-related mortality and damages—correlate with shifts in climate policymaking. Our model positions climate policy indices as independent variables and health outcomes as dependent variables to determine if regions with higher pollution-related health burdens exhibit stronger climate policy responses or if policy stagnation persists despite escalating health crises.
