# The Intersection of Climate Governance and Public Health: A Data-Driven Investigation
Climate policies traditionally focus on environmental sustainability, yet they increasingly intersect with urgent public health concerns. Air pollution represents one of our most critical health challenges, causing millions of premature deaths annually. As climate change intensifies, it exacerbates air pollution through multiple mechanisms: increased desert dust circulation, more frequent and intense wildfires, accelerated ground-level ozone formation, and altered atmospheric patterns that trap pollutants. These processes create a feedback loop where climate governance becomes directly relevant to public health outcomes. Despite this connection, the relationship between health data and climate policy development remains significantly underexplored.

This data-driven analysis examines how public health burdens influence climate policymaking across regional and global scales. We investigate whether worsening health crises catalyze stronger environmental regulations or political and economic constraints prevent policy adaptation despite health evidence. Rather than evaluating how policies reduce emissions, we analyze whether variations in health metrics—particularly air pollution-related mortality and economic damages—correlate with meaningful shifts in climate policy frameworks. Our model positions climate policy indices as independent variables and health outcomes as dependent variables to determine if regions experiencing higher pollution-related health burdens demonstrate stronger policy responses or if policy stagnation persists despite escalating health crises.
